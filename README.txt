ChaosControl v0.5
=====

This plugin adds a special Emerald to the game, renamed Chaos Emerald.  With this in hand and enough XP for power, you are granted the ability to use multiple Chaos Powers.

Currently the Emerald is a very rare drop from villagers (1% chance).

Powers include:
-Chaos Control: teleport to a block in sight.  1 level cost.
-Chaos Blast: create a large explosion centered around yourself, powerful enough to kill a nearby player in protection 4 diamond armor.  60 level cost.

Right-click to switch modes, and left-click to use the emerald's power.

(Note: for powers to work, you must not punch an enemy.  I may fix this later, but at the very least a nearly-always-guaranteed way to trigger the power if you are swarmed is by clicking at your feet.)
