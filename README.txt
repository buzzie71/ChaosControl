ChaosControl v1.0
=====

This plugin adds a special Emerald to the game, renamed Chaos Emerald.  With this in hand and enough XP for power, you are granted the ability to use multiple Chaos Powers.

Currently the Emerald is a very rare drop from villagers (1% chance).

In Survival mode, available Chaos powers include:
-Chaos Control: Teleport to a block in sight, aim and click.  1 level cost.
-Chaos Blast: You are inflicted with Slowness for two seconds while you charge up and unleash a large explosion centered around yourself, powerful enough to kill a nearby player in protection 4 diamond armor.  You are still vulnerable while doing this, and if you die, the blast will not occur.  60 level cost.

Right-click to switch modes, and left-click to use the emerald's power.

In Creative mode, left-click will allow you to teleport to a target block (Chaos Control, but no level cost), and right-click will allow you to move through walls.  (This is simply the developer's personal exercise to replicate the compass in Bukkit Essentials, and is provided in an as-is state only.)

(Note: for powers to work, you must not punch an entity.  I may fix this later, but at the very least a nearly-always-guaranteed way to trigger the power if you are swarmed is by clicking at your feet.)
